A demonstration project showing how to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized computational tools through API endpoints.

## üß† Concept Overview

This project demonstrates a key concept in modern AI systems: **Tools Augmentation**. By combining the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs with specialized computational tools, we create a system that:

1. Understands natural language queries about mathematical problems
2. Routes those queries to the appropriate specialized computational tools
3. Returns results with AI-generated explanations

### The "Tools" Paradigm

In a tools-augmented AI system:

- **The LLM acts as a router and interpreter** - It understands user intent and determines which tool to use
- **Specialized tools handle domain-specific tasks** - Complex mathematical computations, in this case
- **The LLM provides context and explanation** - Making the results more accessible and educational

This approach overcomes the limitations of using LLMs alone, particularly for tasks requiring precise computation or specialized knowledge.

## üöÄ Features

- Natural language input processing using GPT-4
- LaTeX formatting for precise mathematical notation
- Symbolic equation solving using SymPy
- Numerical optimization using SciPy
- FastAPI backend with dedicated computational endpoints
- Streamlit frontend for user interaction
- AI-generated explanations of mathematical solutions

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ai-comp-system-architecture.png)


The system follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Frontend (Streamlit)**
   - Provides user interface
   - Handles LLM communication for query parsing
   - Displays LaTeX-formatted mathematics
   - Presents AI-generated explanations

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**
   - Exposes computational endpoints
   - Handles symbolic computation (SymPy)
   - Performs numerical optimization (SciPy)
   - Returns structured results

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Parses natural language to structured queries
   - Routes requests to appropriate computational tools
   - Generates educational explanations of results

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sudhirnagendragupta/ai-math-system.git
   cd ai-math-system
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create an `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. Start the backend (from the backend directory):
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Start the frontend (from the frontend directory in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8501

## üß™ Example Queries

Try these examples to see the system in action:

- "Solve the equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0"
- "Find the minimum and maximum values of x^2 - 4x + 3"
- "What are the solutions to 2x^2 - 8 = 0?"

## üí° Core Concepts Illustrated

### 1. API Endpoints as Tools

Each computational capability is exposed as a dedicated API endpoint:
- `/solve-equation` - Handles symbolic equation solving
- `/optimize-function` - Performs numerical optimization

This design demonstrates how specialized tools can be modularized and accessed via well-defined interfaces.

### 2. LLM as Router and Interpreter

The system uses GPT-4 to:
- Parse natural language queries into structured data
- Identify the required computational tool
- Format the input appropriately for the tool
- Interpret and explain the results

### 3. Separation of Concerns

The architecture cleanly separates:
- **User interface** (Streamlit frontend)
- **Computational logic** (FastAPI backend)
- **Natural language processing** (LLM integration)

This separation allows each component to be developed, tested, and scaled independently.

## üîç Code Walkthrough

### Backend (FastAPI)

The `main.py` file defines our computational endpoints:

```python
@app.post("/solve-equation", response_model=ComputationResult)
async def solve_equation(input_data: EquationInput):
    # Uses SymPy to solve equations symbolically
    ...

@app.post("/optimize-function", response_model=ComputationResult)
async def optimize_function(input_data: FunctionInput):
    # Uses SciPy to find minimum and maximum values
    ...
```

Each endpoint takes structured input, performs specialized mathematical operations, and returns results in a standardized format.

### Frontend (Streamlit)

The `app.py` file handles:

1. User interface for input and display
2. Communication with the OpenAI API to parse queries
3. Sending structured requests to the appropriate backend endpoint
4. Displaying results and explanations

### LLM Integration

The `extract_math_expression` method demonstrates how to use the LLM as a query parser:

```python
def extract_math_expression(self, text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Uses GPT-4 to extract mathematical expressions from natural language
    and determine the computation type.
    """
    # Crafts a prompt to extract structured data from natural language
    ...
```
